Write a C program to check if there is a negative cycle in a directed graph. A negative cycle is one
in which the overall sum of the weights in the cycle is negative.

Input Format:
• First line contains two integers n ∈ [1, 1000] and m ∈ [1, 1000] denoting the number of vertices
and number of edges present in a directed graph respectively.
• Next m lines contains three integers x, y, w denoting there is a directed edge from x to y
having a weight w.

Output Format:
• Print 1 if there is negative cycle. Otherwise print -1.
Note: - The vertices are labeled from 0 to n-1.



Sample Input:
5 8
0 1 -1
0 2 4
1 2 3
1 3 2
1 4 2
3 2 5
3 1 1
4 3 -3

Sample Output:
-1
